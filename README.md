# Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety—ensuring that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, its "borrow checker" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation. Rust is popularized for systems programming but also has high-level features including some functional programming constructs.

## How to use this Makejail

### Basic usage

Create a `Makejail` in your Rust app project.

```
INCLUDE options/network.makejail
INCLUDE gh+AppJail-makejails/rust

WORKDIR /app
COPY app/

RUN rustc hello.rs

STAGE cmd

WORKDIR /app
RUN ./hello
```

Where `options/network.makejail` are the options that suit your environment, for example:

```
ARG network
ARG interface=rustapp

OPTION virtualnet=${network}:${interface} default
OPTION nat
```

Open a shell and run `appjail makejail`:

```sh
appjail makejail -j rustapp -- --network development
```

To run the application we can use `appjail run`:

```console
# appjail run rustapp
Hello, world!
```

### Using Makejail builders

If we get the size of the previous jail

```console
# appjail stop rustapp
...
# appjail cmd local rustapp du -sh
789M    .
```

we have a very large jail to run a simple binary. For compiled programming languages we could use Makejail builders to reduce the size of the jail.

**Makejail**:

```
OPTION start
OPTION overwrite

EXEC --name rustapp-builder --file build.makejail --arg network=development --arg interface=rstappb

WORKDIR /app
COPY --jail rustapp-builder /app/hello
DESTROY --force rustapp-builder

STAGE cmd

WORKDIR /app
RUN ./hello
```

**build.makejail**:

```
INCLUDE options/network.makejail
INCLUDE gh+AppJail-makejails/rust

WORKDIR /app
COPY app/

RUN rustc hello.rs
```

For simplicity, `Makejail` does not use more options than necessary, but you can use as many as you want without affecting `build.makejail`.

Open a shell and run `appjail makejail`:

```sh
appjail makejail -j rustapp
```

Now our jail with the application we want to run has a very reduced size.

```console
# appjail stop rustapp
...
# appjail cmd local rustapp du -sh
 13M    .
```

Much of the size overhead if for jail, but for big applications this is not harmful.
